PHP Cookies and Sessions

What is protocol?
=> In networking , a protocol is a standardized set of rules
    for formatting and processing data.
    protocols enable computers to communicate with one another.
    e.g .  HTTP, FTP , SMTP

HTTP => follow client-server architecture
        stateless protocol

cookies: A cookie is a small file with a maximun size of 4 KB
        that the web server stores on the client computer.
        cookie can only be read from the domain that it has been issued from.
        Cookies are ususlly set in an HTTP header but
        javaScript can also set a cookie directly on a borwser.

Setting Cookie In PHP:
    setcookie(name, [value] , [expire] , [path] , [domain] , [security]);
    name : set the name of the cookie
    value : set the value of the cookie 
    expire : set the expiry timestamp of cookie 
    path : specify the path on the server for which the cookie will be available. 
    domain : specify the domain for which the cookie is available. 
    security : indicate that the cookie should be sent only if a secure HTTPS connection exists.

    ***The setcookie() function needs to be called prior to any output generated by the script otherwise the cookie will not be set.

    Checking Whether a Cookie Is Set or Not : Whether a cookie is set or not should be checked before accessing its value 


    ***use isset() along with $_COOKIE superglobal
    if(isset($_COOKIE['username']))

    Accessing Cookie Values : by usiing $_COOKIE superglobal

    Deleting Coookies : The setcookie() function can be used to delete a cookie.
                        the expiration date is required to be set in the past.


    *** When you create a cookie via php , the default value for its expiration date is 0,
    which means that the cookie expires when you close the tab.



    PHP Session 

    _________________________


    A PHP sessing stores data on the server rather than user's computer.
    Every user is identified through a unique number called session identifier or SID.
    This unique session ID is used to link each user with their own information on the server like emails,posts, etc.
    Session variables are typically used in applications that need to keep track of a user's activity. 

    Starting a PHP Session:

        session_start();
        used to begin a new session 
        creates a new session ID for the user. 

    Storing Session Data :
        In key-value pairs using $_SESSION[]

    Accessing Session Data:
        using session_start() and corresponding key in $_SESSION associative array.

    Destroying Certain Session Data: the unset feature can be used with the corresponding session variable in the $_SESSION associative array.
    
        session_start();
        if(isset($_SESSION['name'])){
            unset($_SESSION['rolenumber']);
        }

    Destroying Complete Session : use session_destroy()
        session_start();
        session_destroy();
